**Before you initiate a pull request**, please read the process document. Ideas
should be thoroughly discussed on the [root-evolution forum section][forum-root-evolution]
first.

This repository tracks the ongoing evolution of ROOT. It contains:

* Goals for upcoming ROOT releases (this document).
* The [ROOT evolution review status][proposal-status] tracking proposals to
change ROOT.
* The [ROOT evolution process](process.md) that governs the evolution of ROOT.
* [Commonly Rejected Changes](commonly_proposed.md), proposals which have been
denied in the past.

This document describes goals for the ROOT framework on a per-release basis,
usually listing minor releases adding to the currently shipping version and one
major release out. Each release will have many smaller features or changes
independent of these larger goals, and not all goals are reached for each
release.

Goals for past versions are included at the bottom of the document for
historical purposes, but are not necessarily indicative of the features shipped.
The release notes for each shipped version are the definitive list of notable
changes in each release.
