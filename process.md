# ROOT Evolution Process

ROOT is a framework for data processing designed to make handling of big data easier. ROOT is growing and evolving, guided by a community-driven process referred to as the ROOT evolution process. This document outlines the ROOT evolution process and how a feature grows from a rough idea into something that can improve the ROOT development experience for thousands of users.

## Scope

The ROOT evolution process covers all changes to the ROOT framework, including new features and APIs (no matter how small), changes to existing framework features or APIs, removal of existing features, and so on. Smaller changes, such as bug fixes, optimizations, or diagnostic improvements can be contributed via the normal contribution process; see [Contributing to ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/contributing).

## Goals

The ROOT evolution process aims to leverage the collective ideas, insights, and experience of the ROOT community to improve the ROOT development experience. Its two primary goals are:

* Engage the wider ROOT community in the ongoing evolution of ROOT, and
* Maintain the vision and conceptual coherence of ROOT.

There is a natural tension between these two goals. Open evolution processes are, by nature, chaotic. Yet, maintaining a coherent vision for something as complicated as a data processing framework requires some level of coordination. The ROOT evolution process aims to strike a balance that best serves the ROOT community as a whole.

## Participation

Everyone is welcome to propose, discuss, and review ideas to improve the ROOT framework on the [root-evolution forum section][forum-root-evolution]. Before posting a review, please see the section "What goes into a review?" below.

The ROOT [core team](https://root.cern.ch/team) is responsible for the strategic direction of ROOT. Core team members initiate, participate in, and manage the public review of proposals and have the authority to accept or reject changes to ROOT.

## What goes into a review?

The goal of the review process is to improve the proposal under review through constructive criticism and, eventually, determine the direction of ROOT. When writing your review, here are some questions you might want to answer in your review:

* What is your evaluation of the proposal?
* Is the problem being addressed significant enough to warrant a change to ROOT?
* Does this proposal fit well with the feel and direction of ROOT?
* If you have used other tools or libraries with a similar feature, how do you feel that this proposal compares to those?
* How much effort did you put into your review? A glance, a quick reading, or an in-depth study?

Please state explicitly whether you believe that the proposal should be accepted into ROOT.

## How to propose a change

* **Check prior proposals**: many ideas come up frequently, and may either be in active discussion on the forum, or may have been discussed already and have joined the [Commonly Rejected Proposals](commonly_proposed.md) list. Please check the forum archives and this list for context before proposing something new.
* **Consider the goals of the upcoming ROOT release**: Each major ROOT release is focused on a [specific set of goals](README.md) described early in the release cycle. When proposing a change to ROOT, please consider how your proposal fits in with the larger goals of the upcoming ROOT release. Proposals that are clearly out of scope for the upcoming ROOT release will not be brought up for review. If you can't resist discussing a proposal that you know is out of scope, please include the tag `[Out of scope]` in the subject.
* **Socialize the idea**: propose a rough sketch of the idea on the [root-evolution forum section][forum-root-evolution], the problems it solves, what the solution looks like, etc., to gauge interest from the community.
* **Develop the proposal**: expand the rough sketch into a complete proposal, using the [proposal template](0000-template.md), and continue to refine the proposal on the evolution forum section. Prototyping an implementation and its uses along with the proposal is encouraged, because it helps ensure both technical feasibility of the proposal as well as validating that the proposal solves the problems it is meant to solve.
* **Request a review**: initiate a pull request to the [root-evolution repository][root-evolution-repo] to indicate to the core team that you would like the proposal to be reviewed. When the proposal is sufficiently detailed and clear, and addresses feedback from earlier discussions of the idea, the pull request will be accepted. The proposal will be assigned a proposal number as well as a core team member to coordinate the review.
* **Address feedback**: in general, and especially [during the review period][proposal-status], be responsive to questions and feedback about the proposal.

## Review process

The review process for a particular proposal begins when a member of the core team accepts a pull request of a new or updated proposal into the [root-evolution repository][root-evolution-repo]. That core team member becomes the *review coordinator* for the proposal. The proposal is assigned a proposal number (if it is a new proposal), then enters the review queue.

The review coordinator will work with the proposal authors to schedule the review. Reviews usually last a single week, but can run longer for particularly large or complex proposals.

When the scheduled review period arrives, the review coordinator will post the proposal to the [root-evolution forum section][forum-root-evolution] with the subject "[Review]" followed by the proposal title and update the list of active reviews. To avoid delays, it is important that the proposal authors be available to answer questions, address feedback, and clarify their intent during the review period.

After the review has completed, the core team will make a decision on the proposal. The review coordinator is responsible for determining consensus among the core team members, then reporting their decision to the proposal authors and forum section. The review coordinator will update the proposal's state in the [root-evolution repository][root-evolution-repo] to reflect that decision.

## Proposal states
A given proposal can be in one of several states:

* **Awaiting review**: The proposal is awaiting review. Once known, the dates for the actual review will be placed in the proposal document and updated in the [list of proposals](index.xml). When the review period begins, the review coordinator will update the state to *Active review*.
* **Scheduled for review (MONTH DAY...MONTH DAY)**: The public review of the proposal on the [root-evolution forum section][forum-root-evolution] has been scheduled for the specified date range.
* **Active review (MONTH DAY...MONTH DAY)**: The proposal is undergoing public review on the [root-evolution forum section][forum-root-evolution]. The review will continue through the specified date range.
* **Returned for revision**: The proposal has been returned from review for additional revision to the current draft.
* **Withdrawn**: The proposal has been withdrawn by the original submitter.
* **Deferred**: Consideration of the proposal has been deferred because it does not meet the [goals of the upcoming major ROOT release](README.md). Deferred proposals will be reconsidered when scoping the next major ROOT release.
* **Accepted**: The proposal has been accepted and is either awaiting implementation or is actively being implemented.
* **Accepted with revisions**: The proposal has been accepted, contingent upon the inclusion of one or more revisions.
* **Rejected**: The proposal has been considered and rejected.
* **Implemented (ROOT VERSION)**: The proposal has been implemented.
  Append the version number in parenthesesâ€”for example: Implemented (ROOT 6.10).
  If the proposal's implementation spans multiple version numbers,
  write the version number for which the implementation will be complete.
